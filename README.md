# Vasquez Research Documentation

This repository collects canonical documentation, proofs, and artifacts
underlying the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF) and related research.

## Registry Index

The URF registry comprises:

- **URF Core** — foundational axioms and admissibility rules  
  https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/urf-core

- **Chronos–EntropyDepth** — canonical entropy-depth invariants  
  https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/Chronos-EntropyDepth

- **Chronos–URF RR** — reference implementation of Chronos logic  
  https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/chronos-urf-rr

- **URF Prefab System** — canonical prefab definitions  
  https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/urf-prefab-system

- **Cyclone Terminal Obstruction** — locality obstruction definitions  
  https://github.com/inaciovasquez2020/cyclone-terminal-obstruction

## Purpose

Vasquez Docs organizes documentation for these registry members, making
proofs, formalization notes, and conceptual overviews discoverable.
